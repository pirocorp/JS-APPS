//await and parallelism

//In sequentialStart, execution suspends 2 seconds for the first await, 
//and then again another 1 second for the second await. The second timer 
//is not created until the first has already fired. The code finishes 
//after 3 seconds.

//In concurrentStart, both timers are created and then awaited.
//The timers are running concurrently, which means the code finishes  
//in 2 rather than 3 seconds, i.e.the slowest timer.
//However the await calls are still running in series,
//which means the second await will wait for the first one to finish.
//In this case, this leads to the processing of the result of the fastest 
//timer to be performed after the slowest.

//If you wish to fully perform two or more jobs in parallel, 
//you must use await Promise.all([job1(), job2()]) as shown in the 
//parallel example.
